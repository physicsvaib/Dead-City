/*
  * Every component be it transform or any behavior is given a chance to render itself
  * Eg. when any compoenent is selected its transform handle is shown as it is its default behavior
  * When we write a custom script the default behavior is to render nothing
  * Once we start creating complex unity interactions and scripts the default renderer is not the ideal solution, a custom inspector is a suggested way to go
  * All the core windows can be customized, like if we select a 3D model what renders in preview can be customized to our liking
  * Multiple editor folder are allowed
  *
